This version of lab8 is a fork of my original!

When initially doing this lab I took my solution far beyond the scope of the assignment.
I am satisfied with that solution, and I learned a lot along the way to its completion.

However, I feel that the original branch of my solution was too personal to publish.
Thus, I have made this last minute fork where I have replaced all questions, answers, images, etc.
With placeholders such as "FOO BAR BAZ", stock photos, and Minecraft music/textures. (You can never go wrong with Minecraft)

I fully acknowledge the fact that this makes the site look like some sort of Frankenstein experiment.
The layout and overall structure of the site had a specific vision in mind, that feels out of place when generalized in this way.

Nonetheless, I feel it is still important to publish this code.
Since, while the content has been changed, the code remains unaltered.
Plus, this assignment had no styling requirements anyways.
So while it may hurt the eyes to look at, it didn't need to please them.

The focus here is solely implementing the trivia question functionality.
